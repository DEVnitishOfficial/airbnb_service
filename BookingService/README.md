# Airbnb Booking Service - Microservices with Prisma ORM and MySQL

This service handles **booking-related functionalities** of the Airbnb system using **Prisma ORM** and **MySQL** as the primary relational database. The goal is to ensure **data consistency**, **transactional safety**, and **isolation**, especially to prevent issues like **double booking** and **concurrency problems**.

---

## üß† Key Concepts Covered So Far

- **Understanding Microservices**: What they are and why we use them.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Preventing double bookings and other transactional issues.
- **Database Architecture**:
  - `airbnb_booking_dev`: Dedicated to **booking-related data**.
  - `airbnb_dev_mode`: Handles **hotel and room-related data**.
  - These databases are **separate** for better scalability and deployment flexibility.
  - Direct joins **between the databases are not allowed**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Prisma

### Step 1: Install Prisma

```bash
npm install prisma
````

### Step 2: Initialize Prisma in the `src` Folder

```bash
cd src
npx prisma init
```

### Step 3: Cleanup

* Remove the extra `.env` and `.gitignore` files created by Prisma.

### Step 4: Set up the Database URL

Update the `.env` file with your MySQL connection string:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://<user>:<password>@localhost:3306/airbnb_booking_dev"
```

### Step 5: Install Prisma Client

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
```

> **Note**: `@prisma/client` is the actual library that interacts with your database using the Prisma schema.

## üß© Prisma Schema Definition

File: `prisma/schema.prisma`

```prisma
model Booking {
  id             Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId         Int
  hotelId        Int
  createdAt      DateTime      @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime      @updatedAt
  bookingAmount  Int
  status         BookingStatus
}

enum BookingStatus {
  PENDING
  CONFIRMED
  CANCELLED
}
```

> Prisma now supports **modular schema management**, allowing you to split large schemas into multiple files for better scalability.

---

## üîÑ Running Migrations with Prisma

### Initial Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### Adding New Migrations

1. Modify the schema (e.g., add a `totalGuest Int` field).
2. Save the file.
3. Run the migration command:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name added_totalGuest_column_to_Booking_table
```

> This will generate a new folder under `prisma/migrations` for each migration.

---

## üß™ Testing

Once migrations are complete, you can use Prisma Client to interact with your `airbnb_booking_dev` MySQL database.

---

## üìå Notes

* `airbnb_booking_dev` is **independent** of `airbnb_dev_mode`.
* Prisma schema is defined in a single file by default but can now be split into **multiple files**.
* Designed to support **scalable deployment**, including hosting the booking service on a separate machine.
